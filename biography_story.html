		My name is Joey Lai and I live in Calgary, AB. The first programming language I learned was HTML when 
		I was in junior high, making personal websites on a social network called 
		<a href="http://www.calgaryplanet.com" target="_blank">CalgaryPlanet</a> (which unfortunately no longer exists). It
		was not until high school where I found my joy of programming, and decided to make a career out of it.
		I attended SAIT and graduated with an Information Technology Software Development Diploma (with Honors). After 
		working in industry for a year (at <a href="http://www.cgi.com" target="_blank">CGI</a>), I decided to go back to 
		school to receive higher education. I attended Mount Royal University taking their 
		Bachelor of Computer Information Systems program with a minor in Business (Management). 
		It was also during that time where I joined a company called 
		<a href="http://www.itfordev.com" target="_blank">ITforDev</a> as an independent software developer consultant
		and started my own company, jlai Consulting Inc.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have industry experience for many technologies such as Java, C# .NET, javascript/jQuery. I also enjoy discovering
		new technologies such as Git, and various architectural frameworks such as MVC and Spring. I practice agile
		methodologies, test driven development, and design patterns. I hope to improve my
		programming skills and learn more about software architecture to become a leader and mentor in software development.
